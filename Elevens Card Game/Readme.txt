This Project was based on a framework with basic class declarations. 
I implemented all classes and functions, and combined them with GUI elements to create the game file.

How to play:
-Choose 2 cards that add up to 11 and click "Replace", 2 new cards well be dealt from the deck.
-Keep replacing cards and empty the deck to win the game.
-If no card pair add up to 11, the game is lost.
-Jack, Queen and King together can be replaced as a special case.
